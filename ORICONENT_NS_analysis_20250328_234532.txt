    ## Executive Summary

    ## **INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION: HOLD**

Based on the provided analysis of Oricon Enterprises Ltd (ORICONENT.NS), we maintain a **HOLD** rating for this equity at its current price of 39.94, with considerations as outlined below.

### Price Targets:  
| Scenario          | Target Price       | Timeframe |
| ------------------ | --------------------|----------:|
| Bearish           | RM25                | Within the next 6 months    |
| Base              | RM40               | Within the next year        |
| Bullish           | RM55               | Beyond a year          |

### **Key Factors Supporting our Recommendation**:  
- The company's return of 6.31% over the last year has outperformed Nifty50 (6.05%). This suggests that ORICONENT is capable of delivering relatively strong returns compared to a broad market benchmark, indicating potential for continued long-term performance despite recent volatility in revenues and net profitability.
- The recovery observed earlier in 2024 shows the company's ability to bounce back from periods of negative profitability. This suggests that management may be capable of navigating challenging market conditions effectively, potentially leading to improved future results.
- Oricon Enterprises has demonstrated a capacity for significant growth during more favorable quarters (e.g., September '24's net profit peak), indicating the potential for strong performance under better economic or industry conditions. This suggests that the stock may offer upside if market trends turn positive in the future, making it suitable for investors with a longer time horizon and tolerance for short-term fluctuations.

### **Main Risk Factors**:  
* The company's revenue has been on a decline over several quarters (from RM74.5 million in December '23 to RM34.1 million in December '24). This downward trend may continue and negatively impact future profitability, potentially leading to further stock depreciation if not addressed by management.
* The stock's short-term performance relative to market benchmarks has been inconsistent, suggesting that ORICONENT is more susceptible to short-term volatility or sector-specific headwinds. This could lead to additional price swings and increased investment risk for short-term traders or those seeking consistent returns over shorter timeframes.

### Expected Timeframe:  
Our projected timeframe is as follows: the bearish target of RM25 may be reached within the next 6 months, while our base case scenario predicts a rise to RM40 within the next year and a bullish target at RM55 beyond one year. However, these are estimates based on current market conditions and past performance; actual results could differ due to unforeseen events or changes in market sentiment towards ORICONENT or its industry sector.

It is crucial for investors to monitor any announcements from the company regarding financial performance, strategic initiatives, or shifts in the broader economic landscape that might affect Oricon Enterprises' prospects. This will enable timely decision-making and adjustment of your portfolio as needed.

    ## Detailed Analysis

    <div style="background-color:#f9f9f9; padding:10px; border-radius:5px; margin-bottom:20px;">
    <h3>1. Fundamental Analysis</h3>
    Oricon Enterprises Ltd (ORICONENT.NS) has exhibited a decline in revenue over the past several quarters, from RM74.5 million in December '23 to RM34.1 million in December '24. This represents sequential quarterly decreases of 30.8% and 49.3% respectively. While net profit was negative in December '23 (-RM4.5 million), it improved significantly over the next two quarters, peaking at RM127.6 million in September '24 before declining again to RM0.6 million by December '24. This suggests a volatile period for profitability despite the recovery seen earlier in 2024.
   
The company's operating margin has been consistently negative, indicating that its costs are exceeding revenues and thus affecting profitability. The highest recorded operating margin was -13.09% in September '24, while the lowest was -27.36% in March '24. This suggests poor efficiency in managing expenses relative to income generation.
   
Oricon Enterprises' Return on Equity (ROE) has been declining over the past five years, dropping from 19.59% in March '22 to 1.48% in March '24. This indicates that the company is becoming less effective at generating profits with its available equity capital. The Return on Assets (ROA) also shows a similar downward trend, dropping from 12.45% in March '22 to 0.87% in March '24. This indicates that the company is becoming less efficient at using its assets to generate profits.
   
The Debt-to-Equity ratio has been relatively stable over the past five years, with a slight decrease from 0.35 in March '21 to 0.3 in March '24. This suggests that the company's financial health is not detercibly affected by its debt levels relative to equity financing. The Price-to-Book Value has been declining over the past five years, from 0.68 in March '21 to 0.7 in March '24. This indicates that investors are paying less for each dollar of book value per share than they have historically.
   
Overall, Oricon Enterprises Ltd (ORICONENT.NS) shows a downward trend in both its revenue and profitability metrics over the past several quarters. This suggests that there may be concerns about the company's long-term financial performance. However, its debt levels relative to equity financing have remained stable, indicating that it is not unduly burdened by debt obligations. The declining Price-to-Book Value metric indicates that investors are currently valuing the company at a lower price per share of book value than they have historically. This suggests that the market may be bearish on the company's long-term prospects, but further analysis would be needed to confirm this sentiment.
   
In conclusion, Oricon Enterprises Ltd (ORICONENT.NS) has exhibited declining revenue and profitability metrics over the past several quarters while maintaining relatively stable debt levels relative to equity financing. The company's valuation appears lower than historical norms based on Price-to-Book Value, which may suggest a bearish market sentiment towards its long-term prospects. Further analysis would be needed to confirm these trends and assess the underlying causes for Oricon Enterprises Ltd's (ORICONENT.NS) recent financial performance.
   
Strength: The company has managed to maintain relatively stable debt levels relative to equity financing over the past five years, suggesting a degree of stability in its financial health. 

Weaknesses: The decline in revenue and profitability metrics indicates concerns about Oricon Enterprises Ltd's (ORICONENT.NS) long-term prospects, while the decreasing Price-to-Book Value suggests that investors may be bearish on its future outlook.

    <h3>2. Technical Analysis</h3>
    Oricon Enterprises Ltd (ORICONENT.NS) currently trades at a price of 39.94, with several key technical indicators providing insight into the stock's momentum and potential future movement. Let us analyze these factors to develop a clear understanding of the current market situation for this equity.

1. Based on the provided data, Oricon Enterpr vice's RSI stands at 52.7, indicating that it is neither overbought nor oversold but maintaining a neutral sentiment in terms of trade volume and price action. The ADX value at 15.7 confirms this stance as the index indicates no clear trend direction with values generally ranging from 20 to 40 for an established trend, while MFI (Money Flow Index) also shows a moderate reading of 40.1 further supporting the market's relatively neutral sentiment. The MACD line at zero suggests that there is no divergence or convergence between short-term and long-term price movements, thus not providing clear bullish or bearish indications.
   
2. Examining the key support and resistance levels reveals several important thresholds. A notable level of support can be found at 38.1150 (SMA100) which also coincides with a prior trough, making it a crucial level to monitor for any potential bounce-backs in price action. Conversely, significant resistance levels are observed at the higher end around 41.46 and slightly lower at 40.98, both of which have been tested previously by market participants leading to possible consolidation or sell-offs if prices approach these zones.
   
3. The momentum score stands at a relatively high level of 65.1 signaling some underlying bullish sentiment within the trading community despite the neutral trend indicators. This can be attributed to recent price performance, wherein Oricon Enterprises Ltd showed gains over various time horizons: +0.78% on a one-day basis and upward movement of 4.42% yearly. It is critical to note that the stock has been experiencing incremental progress as indicated by moving averages; SMA20 and SMA100 are both above current prices, suggesting a supportive environment for the trend's continuation in the short term.
   
4. Considering these technical factors, potential price targets might be set around 41.46 - 41.75 if bullish sentiment persists and there is momentum to break through the resistance levels mentioned earlier. However, caution should be exercised given that RSI, MACD, and ADX are indicating a neutral or sideways market trend with no clear directionality established yet.
   
Overall, the technical outlook for Oricon Enterprises Ltd (ORICONENT.NS) appears to be relatively balanced, displaying neither strong bullish nor bearish signals. The key support and resistance levels provide guidance on potential areas of interest where market participants might react accordingly. It is crucial that investors monitor the stock's behavior as it approaches these levels for a clearer indication of its future direction.

    <h3>3. Historical Performance Analysis</h3>
    Oricon Enterprises Ltd (ORICONENT.NS) has demonstrated notable performance when analyzed against relevant benchmarks such as Nifty50, Sensex, industry, and sector returns over various periods ranging from one month to five years. Over the last year, Oricon's return of 6.31% slightly outperformed the Nifty50 with a return of 6.05%. However, in shorter time frames such as one month and three months, the stock underperformed compared to these indices. This suggests that while ORICONENT has had stronger annual performance relative to broad market benchmarks over the long term, it may be more susceptible to short-term volatility or sector-specific headwinds in the shorter time frames.


Upon examining the seasonal patterns of returns for each year from 2023 to 2025, a pattern does not distinctly emerge that would indicate consistent cyclical behavior related to specific months or seasons within this dataset alone. It is worth noting though, in both 2024 and 2025 the company experienced its best month performance at the end of the year (December for 2024 with a 21.27% return), while the worst months were towards the beginning or mid-year periods (-22.74% in February 2023 and -11.06% in May 2
Sorry, I've repeated myself. Let me correct that:

Oricon Enterprises Ltd (ORICONENT.NS) has demonstrated notable performance when analyzed against relevant benchmarks such as Nifty50, Sensex, industry, and sector returns over various periods ranging from one month to five years. Over the last year, Oricon's return of 6.31% slightly outperformed the Nifty50 with a return of 6.05%. However, in shorter time frames such as one month and three months, the stock underperformed compared to these indices. This suggests that while ORICONENT has had stronger annual performance relative to broad market benchmarks over the long term, it may be more susceptible to short-term volatility or sector-specific headwinds in the shorter time frames.

Upon examining the seasonal patterns of returns for each year from 2023 to 2025, a pattern does not distinctly emerge that would indicate consistent cyclical behavior related to specific months or seasons within this dataset alone. It is worth noting though, in both 2024 and 2025 the company experienced its best month performance at the end of the year (December for 2024 with a 21.27% return), while the worst months were towards the beginning or mid-year periods (-22.74% in February 2023 and -11.06% in May 2025). Despite these occasional downturns, there is no clear cyclical pattern discernible from this limited data that consistently impacts performance based on seasonality alone.

When considering long-term trends over a five-year period, ORICONENT has shown exceptional growth with a staggering return of 171.58% compared to the Nifty50's 159.65%. This remarkable performance indicates strong relative strength and suggests that despite short-term underperformance in certain months or quarters, ORICONENT has been able to deliver substantial long-term gains which might be attributed to effective strategic decisions and potential industry leadership.

As for the company's relative strength versus the market during different conditions: over a one-month period, Oricon showed resilience with positive returns when compared against its peers in the sector (2.04%) but fell short of broader indices like Nifty50 and Sensex. However, over longer durations such as three years and five years, ORICONENT's performance significantly outshined industry averages by multiples (166.23% vs 37.12%, respectively). This indicates that ORICONENT may possess a robust business model or competitive advantage that enables it to capitalize on market trends better than its peers, although further analysis would be required to ascertain the exact reasons for this outperformance and whether it is sustainable in the long term.
